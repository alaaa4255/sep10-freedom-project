# Presentation Plan

## Hook
*I will start by talking about a couple of different business in our world. Then I will introduce the fact that every business operates on both software ad hardware no matter what.

## Product
*As I start presenting, I will summerize all the software info in one sentence while skimming through the links of the websites listed.
* For the hardware part, i will do the same thing while showing them the images but then I will also tell them spefically what type of business use the hardwares that I have listed.
*For the A-frame part i will show them what i built why telling them why i chose a-frame and why i speficlaly designed what i did.

## Process
* I will talk about why i chose my topic to be business and what interested me about it all in one sentence. In the next sentence I will talk about what coding I used (bootstrap, html,css). I will show them the hardest parts and how i overcame that.

## Conclusion
* When I am done, I will reepahrse/highlight the parts i want them to learn from my project. for example, how and why spefic business use the hardwares that i listed. 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
