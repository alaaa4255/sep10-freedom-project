## context: 
<p> When I started to reaserach on information for my topic, the first thing I put into the search bar was "what are softwares that bussiness owners use".A website filled with everything that I needed to know popped up. So, after scrolling through the website and writing what I learned in my notes, I knew I found everything I needed to find. Additionally, gathering and collecting information on my topic regarding bussiness, I came to discover many things I did not know about from before. Things such as certain technologies that many bussiness used being software based. The best thing about the wesbite that I used, was that it listed almost every software app and wesbite that was significant for me to know. Now for the hardware technologies, I decided to use multiple wesbites to learn about hardware since I had trouble finding a wesbite that had everything about hardwarw in it. While searching about that, I came to the reliziation that software and hardware technolgy are bassically almsot completly different from eachother. However, It was interesting to see some of the hardware that people may not know of get usedrequalrly in bussiness.  </p>
