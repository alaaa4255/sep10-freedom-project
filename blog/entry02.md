## context: 
<p> When I started to reaserach on information for my topic, the first thing I put into the search bar was "what are softwares that bussiness owners use". A website filled with everything that I needed to know popped up. So, after scrolling through the website and writing what I learned in my notes, I knew I found everything I needed to find. Additionally, gathering and collecting information on my topic regarding bussiness, I came to discover many things I did not know about from before. Things such as certain technologies that many bussiness used being software based. The best thing about the wesbite that I used, was that it listed almost every software app and wesbite that was significant for me to know. Now for the hardware technologies, I decided to use multiple wesbites to learn about hardware since I had trouble finding a wesbite that had everything about hardware in it. While searching about that, I came to the reliziation that software and hardware technolgy are bassically almsot completly different but yet the same from eachother. However, It was interesting to see some of the hardware that people may not know of get used requalrly in bussiness. For finding information on software, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-business-software/"> this was the wesbite that I used</a>. In the website, three out of the many apps I came across was <a href= "https://onpay.com/payroll-services-lp/?channel=forbes&utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=smb&FRBSADV_adtid=FAPfLUevisaevIkIhfhaqB_xxm2JD5I5fHj">App #1</a> which helps bussiness owners automate their payments to their employees that are overseas.<a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/lp/lasting-customer-relationships.html?utm_source=forbesadvisor&utm_medium=cpl&utm_campaign=zcrm-review-fa">App #2</a>helps create a personilized sales and marketing preformance as well as manage leads and people who interact with the bussiness. <a href="https://get.cin7.com/inventory-management-software-mm?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=PPL&utm_campaign=forbes">App #3</a>provides the bussiness a way to organize more better. Like track orders or shipments and manage warehouses. For hardware, three of the many websites I came across were <a href="https://stripe.com/resources/more/how-do-card-readers-work">Card readers</a> and it provides the abilty to let card transactions ho through faster while also documenting the transactions in case of a misunderstanding and or emergency. <a href="https://www.mation.com/products/it-hardware-managed-it/">Servers</a> help handle and process large amounts of data, manage network resources, and provide services to other computers or devices on a network. <a href="https://www.mation.com/products/it-hardware-managed-it/">peripherals</a> increase functions in computers,scan documents,and make presentations.  </p>

## Enfineering design bussiness: 
<p> Now that I have collected a significant amount of information involiving my topic, my next step is too learn how I can connect all thw software and hardware techonolgues to todays world's bussiness. I will google if every type of bussiess usees the same technolgies and if any technolgies today have been dropped for something better. I will also begin too learn if busniess make their own websites that they use to benefit from.</p>

## Skills: 
<p> Skills that I had learned after my reaserch, was how too google for the right websites, how to break down the artciles into little details so that I could summerize it and make it easier, and how too only look for the important infromation.</p>

## Googling for the right websites: 
<p>So, when I started to google for wesbites, I made sure to always be specific with what I put in the search bar and always look for websites that end with .org or.com since i knew that i could rely on them. </p>

## Breaking down articles:
<p>A lot of the times, the articles that I came across were really long and packed with information, So, I skimmed through the artciles, gathered the most important and basic details, and created a summary in my head to help me understand what the whole article was tring to tell me. This was so helpful when it cames to taking notes on what I learned In the article.</p>

## Looking for important information: 
<p> To help me get the imprtant information I needed, I always looked at the headings in the article. If the headings were titled what I needed to see, I would read the text. I would also always look at any pictures that are attached next to the text because they were always a giveaway on what the article would be about. This helped me pick and choose what I thought I needed to know </p>
