## context: 
<p> When I started to reaserach on information for my topic, the first thing I put into the search bar was "what are softwares that bussiness owners use". A website filled with everything that I needed to know popped up. So, after scrolling through the website and writing what I learned in my notes, I knew I found everything I needed to find. Additionally, gathering and collecting information on my topic regarding bussiness, I came to discover many things I did not know about from before. Things such as certain technologies that many bussiness used being software based. The best thing about the wesbite that I used, was that it listed almost every software app and wesbite that was significant for me to know. Now for the hardware technologies, I decided to use multiple wesbites to learn about hardware since I had trouble finding a wesbite that had everything about hardware in it. While searching about that, I came to the reliziation that software and hardware technolgy are bassically almsot completly different but yet the same from eachother. However, It was interesting to see some of the hardware that people may not know of get used requalrly in bussiness. For finding information on software, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-business-software/"> this was the wesbite that I used</a>. In the website, three out of the many apps I came across was <a href= "https://onpay.com/payroll-services-lp/?channel=forbes&utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=smb&FRBSADV_adtid=FAPfLUevisaevIkIhfhaqB_xxm2JD5I5fHj">App #1</a> which helps bussiness owners automate their payments to their employees that are overseas.<a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/lp/lasting-customer-relationships.html?utm_source=forbesadvisor&utm_medium=cpl&utm_campaign=zcrm-review-fa">App #2</a>helps create a personilized sales and marketing preformance as well as manage leads and people who interact with the bussiness. <a href="https://get.cin7.com/inventory-management-software-mm?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=PPL&utm_campaign=forbes">App #3</a>provides the bussiness a way to organize more better. Like track orders or shipments and manage warehouses. For hardware, three of the many websites I came across were <a href="https://stripe.com/resources/more/how-do-card-readers-work">Card readers</a> and it provides the abilty to let card transactions ho through faster while also documenting the transactions in case of a misunderstanding and or emergency. <a href="https://www.mation.com/products/it-hardware-managed-it/">Servers</a> help handle and process large amounts of data, manage network resources, and provide services to other computers or devices on a network. <a href="https://www.mation.com/products/it-hardware-managed-it/">peripherals</a> increase functions in computers,scan documents,and make presentations.  </p>
