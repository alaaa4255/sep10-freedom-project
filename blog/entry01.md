#### Choosing a topic

<p> When the time had come to finally offically choose a topic, I decided on business. For a while, the topic of bussiness had me really interested. I became very curious on how businesses run on a daily basis because I saw how my uncle ran his and found it comepelling. So, when I was introduced to the freedom project, one of my top choices was business. Before that, I was very hesitate to pick that as my topic because I wasn't sure I could link busniess with technology and see if they connect. However, as I searched about the many ways technology has helped businesses, I became confident that the topic of business for this project is perfect. Some articles/websites that helped me fully understand the ways technology can help business are <a href="https://www.herzing.edu/blog/impact-technology-business"> "impacts of technolgy on business"</a> by Jessica Neddersen,<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/technology-improve-business-2188.html"> "How does technology improve a business?" </a> by Patrick Gleeson, as well as <a href="https://www.yittbox.com/blog-detail/8-benefits-of-technology-in-business"> "Benefits of technolgy in business"</a> by Yittbox. These articles/websites provided me clear information on the many ways technology has been and continues to be benefical for business. The way these articles talked about the great ways technology supported and boosted business all around the world, fasinated me a lot. It fasinated me because, at first I truly believed businesses were generated on just communication in person and many paper documents. Then, I got to learn about the step up technology took that helped the big and small bussinesses thrive singnifcantly. </p> 

#### Engineering design process 

<p> As if right now with the engineering desgin proccess, my main priority is that with this project I could help **bring and provide more attention and knowledge to the astonishing facts about the great impacts technolgy has had on businessess over the years** since people don't seem to notice much. My next step is too google and look more into my priority. Not only that, but I will go ahaed and ask around about what people know and think about this topic. </p>

#### Skills

<p> skills I learned while working on this blog were googling techniques, writing techniques, and reading techniques, </p>

#### Googling techniques

<p> When I first started to google for information about my topic, I found myselef staring at a bunch of websites. Just by seeing that, I didn't know which one to click on that will give me the information I needed. So, to make it easier on myself, I picked the one with the headline that attracted my attention the most. For example, one of the couple of articles that spiked my interest was <a href="https://www.yittbox.com/blog-detail/8-benefits-of-technology-in-business"> "Benefits of technolgy in bussiness"</a> by Yittbox. At the specific moment I felt the urge to click on it because just based off the headline "Benefits of technology in bussiness" I knew that it was what I should be reading to help me learn more.  </p>

#### Writing techniques

<p> Developing the way of making my writing a little bit more interesting and antcipating was one of my skills because I know without knowing how to write, my work will not make sense and will not make whoever is reading it interested in what I have to say about my passion for my topic as well as my main focus and purpose for it. In order for my writing to improve, I started to practice writing daily wether it was just very detailed notes on what I have to get done through the day, a fiction story telling, a non-fiction report, etc. For example, If I had just finished reading a short novel, I would summerize the story in the most detailed way I could without repeating myself. This really helped me become a little more aware with the way I word things.  </p>

#### Reading techniques

<p> Reading would also become a skill I develop because, I knew in order for me to be able to understand what I needed to look for exactly when searching about my topic, I had to be able to comperhand it fully and perfectly. Big words and complicated words always confused me and made me loose focus of what I was just reading. To be able to get rid of that habit, I took the words that I wasn't familar with, googled them, and continusley read it's defintion and ways it could be used in sentences. For example, while I was reading the word "sophisticated" had showed up. So, I googled it and learned it's defintion as well as ways it is used in sentences. This really helped me understand what the text was trying to tell me.  </p>

#### Summary

<p> In summary, I am so ready to create a website talking and teaching all about the inner workings of technology when it comes to business. Maybe a couple of years from now when I am at college, I end up majoring in bussiness and later open my own company. </p>
