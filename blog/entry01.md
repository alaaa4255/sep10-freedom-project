####<p> Choosing a topic </p>

<p> When the time had come to finally offically choose a topic, I decided on bussiness. For a while, the topic of bussiness had me really interested. I became very curious on how bussinesses run on a daily basis, wether it was marketing or sales or even accouting. So, when i was introduced to the freedom project, one of my top choices was bussiness. Before that, I was very hestaite to pick that as my topic because I wasnt sure i could link bussniess with technology and see if they connect. However, as I searched about the many ways technolgy has helped bussinesses, I became confident that the topic of bussiness for this project is perfect. Some articles/websites that helped me fully understand the ways technolgy can help bussiness are <a href="https://www.herzing.edu/blog/impact-technology-business"> "impacts of technolgy on bussiness"</a> by Jessica Neddersen,<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/technology-improve-business-2188.html"> "How does technology improve a bussiness?" </a>  as well as <a href="https://www.yittbox.com/blog-detail/8-benefits-of-technology-in-business"> "Benefits of technolgy in bussiness"</a>.   </p>
