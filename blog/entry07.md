### Content:
<p>After working on our freedom projects for about 2 weeks and even going as far as adding to the project beyond the required miniumum, we had to present. There was two presentations we were required to give. In class presentataions where we would have to present to the class and the expo elevator pitch presentation where we had to present to other school memebers and to judges who would judge who met the requirments of the best project. For the class presentation, we had to first create a  <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMPCaxwMq8ain78ncZDmnkqpN7YxfFfB-JeOuHRwfxI/edit?tab=t.0"> plan</a> . The plan was about what we  were going to mention/say about our project, how we were going to introduce our websites, explain how we made it and what we uses, the challenges, and the takeaways. We then had to take the plan and put it onto <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XNI2izt7QTFGziOyF_a6zKHU3_FJCtp9MfJrelPARD8/edit?slide>slides</a> that explained all that. For the expo elevator pitch presentation, we had to present the slides and show off our websites in the same manner we did with the in class presentations. We also had to tell them our challenges and takeaways. Then for both presentations, we had to be able to answer any questions there was about our website whether it was from our peers or the judges. </p>

### Egineering desgining process:
<p>Now that I have completed the year all project that I have been working on, my next steps are to prepare for the next year and learn from any of the mistakes I did during this process so that I do not repeat them again. I learned many things from this and will use the things that I learned to create an even better project next year.</p>

### Challenges: 
<p> The challengesnI faced while presenting was projecting my voice. Throughout the whole presentation I spoke at a tone where not everyone was able to hear me. I didnt know at what tone I had to speak, whenter a little lower or a little louder. For thje in-class presentations is where I struggled. For the expo presentation, I was able to do way better since I had caught on to my mistake in the in class presentation. </p>

### Takeawats:
<ul>
  <Li> Speaking clearly and not rushing through the presentation helps people understand everything you are saying. </Li>
  <Li> Speaking at the perfect tone where everyone could hear will help everyone be able to know what you are saying and keep up with everything that is being discussed</Li>
