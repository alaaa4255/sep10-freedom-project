### Content;
<p>After working on our freedom projects for about 2 weeks and even going as far as adding to the project beyond the required miniumum, we had to present. There was two presentations we were required to give. In class presentataions where we would have to present to the class and the expo elevator pitch presentation where we had to present to other school memebers and to judges who would judge who met the requirments of the best project. For the class presentation, we had to first create a  <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMPCaxwMq8ain78ncZDmnkqpN7YxfFfB-JeOuHRwfxI/edit?tab=t.0"> plan</a> . The plan was about what we  were going to mention/say about our project, how we were going to introduce our websites, explain how we made it and what we uses, the challenges, and the takeaways. We then had to take the plan and put it onto slides that explained all that. For the expo elevator pitch presentation, we had to present the slides and show off our websites in the same manner we did with the in class presentations. We also had to tell them our challenges and takeaways. </p>
