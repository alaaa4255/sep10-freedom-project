### Context:
<p>I spent about 3-4 weeks learning the tool I chose to work with for my freedom project. In the 3-4 weeks I was given, I watched vidoes and looked through websites trying to get the best understanding on A-Frame. At some point, I started to use the A-Frame codes that I learned, to code something on my own. At first, coding it on my own was very diffcult even after reading about how A-Frame is used. So, I created something that was the most simplest and basic of A-Frame. It was 3d shapes such as boxes. As I continued to practice and understood the basics of it strongly, its use became very clear. Since I now new the fundemnetals of the tool, it was easy for me to start thinking about how I would want to use A-Frame in my freedom project. The vidoes that I watched to help me learn my tool was; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1RdCVuu98&t=17s"> A-Frame for begginers </a>, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoaFIScwkA0"> Facts about A-Frame</a> and, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I"> A-Frame with react </a> </p>
