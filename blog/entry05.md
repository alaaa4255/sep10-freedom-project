### Context:
<p>I spent about 3-4 weeks learning the tool I chose to work with for my freedom project. In the 3-4 weeks I was given, I watched vidoes and looked through websites trying to get the best understanding on A-Frame. At some point, I started to use the A-Frame codes that I learned, to code something on my own. At first, coding it on my own was very diffcult even after reading about how A-Frame is used. So, I created something that was the most simplest and basic of A-Frame. It was 3d shapes such as boxes. As I continued to practice and understood the basics of it strongly, its use became very clear. Since I now new the fundemnetals of the tool, it was easy for me to start thinking about how I would want to use A-Frame in my freedom project. The vidoes that I watched to help me learn my tool was; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1RdCVuu98&t=17s"> A-Frame for begginers </a>, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoaFIScwkA0"> Facts about A-Frame</a> and, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I"> A-Frame with react </a> </p>

### Engineering design proccess
<p>So, when it came to learning the codes of A-Frame, I had to also learn a little bit of geometry. This was because, most of the things I built, used a lot of content from geometry, For example things like, Box, Sphere, Plane, Cylinder, Cone, Tetrahedron, Torus, Ring, Dodecahedron, Custom models. With the information on geometry, I was able to code the 3d shape a little easier. This helped me develop skills for coding A-Frame.</p>

### Skills that I learned:
<p> The skills I learned for A-frame were the basic html that is used specifically for A-Frame. That wouldd be; `a-box`</p>



   ``` html
 <a-scene> 
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 2; height: 0.2; depth: 2" material="color: brown" position="0 1 -5"></a-entity>
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 2; height: 2; depth: 0.2" material="color: brown" position="0 2.1 -5"></a-entity>
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 0.2; height: 1; depth: 0.2" material="color: brown" position="-0.9 0.5 -4.9"></a-entity>
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 0.2; height: 1; depth: 0.2" material="color: brown" position="0.9 0.5 -4.9"></a-entity>
      <!-- Chair Legs (Back Left) -->
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 0.2; height: 1; depth: 0.2" material="color: brown" position="-0.9 0.5 -5.1"></a-entity>
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 0.2; height: 1; depth: 0.2" material="color: brown" position="0.9 0.5 -5.1"></a-entity<>
      <a-camera position="0 2 7" look-controls="enabled: true"></a-camera>
      <a-light type="directional" position="2 4 -3" intensity="1.5"></a-light>
    </a-scene>
