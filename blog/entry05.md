### Context: 
<p>I spent aout 3-4 weeks learing my tool. I watched videos, looked at websites that had lot's of informtan about A-Frame coding, and even created things using the A-Frame codes. I learned how to make 3d objects like boxes. Most importantly, I learned the rles of A-Frame and what I needd to use in order to create something correctly. Since, A-Frame inloved a lot of numers because of th 3d shapes, I tried m best to teach myself how and when to use specfic numbers depening n what  I was buliding/creating. At first, I visted webstes that guided A-Frame coding. I cam acros one website, teaching people how to code a 3d object. That was the wesite I used the first couple of days. So, i started to follow along the text and copy the codes that I saw. I made sure to read about the codes and what each thing was used for. Then, when I started to get thee hang of it.   </p>
