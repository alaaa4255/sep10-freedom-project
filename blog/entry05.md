### Context:
<p>I spent aout 3-4 weeks learing my tool. I watched videos, looked at websites that had lot's of informtan about A-Frame coding, and even created things using the A-Frame codes.

So, i started to follow along the text and copy the codes that I saw. I made sure to read about the codes and what each thing was used for. Then, when I started to get thee hang of it it tried to create things by myself without using any guidnessss to help me code out what i was trying to make. It was hard and very confusing the first couple of tries. So, I went back to watching videos t help me reach my end goal. After a whilee, I tried coding agan. I attempted to make a 3d box. Due to the many videos I watched, I was able to code most of the design on my own before i started to get fusturated and confused.
