<p> In SEP, we have completed most of the steps regarding our freedom projects. Our most recent step was to find a tool and tinker with it to see if we are able to handle the coding of the tool. We were required to list three tools we took the most interest in after looking at the document provided with many litsed tools. We had to pick three so that we have a backup incase the first tool we try to code ends up being very diffcult. In order to know whether the tool you picked works for you or not was by watching tutorials of how your tool is used and how to use the codes of it to create something. You also had to read and search about in what many ways your tool is used. However most importantly, we had to try out the codes ourselves. When I went over the document with the many tools listed the first tool that grabbed my attention was <a href="https://aframe.io/" > aframe</a> because I was very interested in seeing how I code something and turn it 3D.   </p>
