### Topic: Tool (Business)

### Context: 
<p> In SEP, we have completed most of the steps regarding our freedom projects. Our most recent step was to find a tool and tinker with it to see if we are able to handle the coding of the tool. We were required to list three tools we took the most interest in after looking at the document provided with many litsed tools. We had to pick three so that we have a backup incase the first tool we try to code ends up being very diffcult. In order to know whether the tool you picked works for you or not was by watching tutorials of how your tool is used and how to use the codes of it to create something. However most importantly, we had to try out the codes ourselves. When I went over the document with the many tools listed the first tool that grabbed my attention was <a href="https://aframe.io/" > A-Frame</a> because I was very interested in seeing how I could code something and turn it 3D. As I look on the website I see many examples/showcasees. One of the many things I looked at for aframe was the <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/"> introduction </a> for it. I was given a visual of how a preview of aframe code looks like. There was also a description of what aframe was, which I learned A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experience. To get a deeper undertanding of how to use A-Frame I watched tutorials on youtube like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_FIByQUAI&list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84"> A-Frame for beginners</a>. The youtube video helped me understand even more since I got to follow along as the person showed me how to code and use A-Frame. Lastly, I wanted to look at projects that had A-Frame used so that I could see what a final product of the code would look like. One of the projects I looked at was <a href="https://aframe.io/a-blast/"> A-Blast </a>. The project looked very nice and organized and I could tell there was a lot of creaticity put in it while the person was coding. This made my interest for A-Frame become stronger. This what I did to know if I was able to handle A-Frame.

### Engineering Design Process: 
<p> Now, In SEP I have processed the tools bussiness use both software and hardwares, I brainstormed Ideas of hardwares that could be useful for business in the near future, and have chosen a coding tool to use for the project. The next step would be to think of ways I could use A-Frame in my freedom ptoject. This would be benfical because it will help me able to come up with ideas of what I could do with it in terms of creativity. All of this will also help me start preparing how I want to set up my project when i start it.   </p>

### Skills: 
<p> For this step, some skills I had to adapt was looking in the right places when learning about the tool I had chosen. I did this by looking deeply into the website I visted. I looked for links and subtitles that was able to the tell me the most about A-Frame. When It came to watching youtube vidoes for tutotials of the tool, I made sure to watch vidoes that was for begineers so that I could understand the basics of A-frame. </p>

### Challenges: 
<p>One challenge I faced throughout this process was debating whether I wanted to continue with the A-Frame tool for my project or pick something else. At first when I wasn't putting an effort to learn about the tool I found myself having a hard time undersanding how to use the tool. I found it diffcult and too much to deal with. However, when we were given another day to figure out what tool we want to pick, I used the skills I stated to learn more abour A-Frame. I gave learning about the tool another chance and decided that i wanted to use it. </p>

### Summary:
<p>In conclusion, I have found a tool I am commited to using despite finding touble in how to use it at first. I looked at many tutorials and examples and that helped deepen my understanding even more. So now that I chose a tool for the project, I am ready too use it and do many things with it. </p>
