<p> Up untill now in the jounrey of my freedom project, I have so far accomplised Four parts. Part one was gathering information about softwares businesses use on a daily or just overall. I had to find links and eloborate on what i found about each software. Part two was just like part A except this time I had to find hardwares that bussiness use. Now for the most recent parts such a part three and four,I had to create a list and come up with future technologies. More specifically for part three, I had to collect everything I did for Parts one and two and create a organized/ordered list. Meaning, that I had to to choose in what way I would want to organize my list of softwares and hardwares. I chose to list the softwares and hardwares of my project based off of how much they cost. I put the most expensive on the top and the least on the bottom.I ended up finding the prices of the softwares by searching through google. I found that <a href="https://www.cin7.com/pricing/"> Cin7</a> was the most expensive software of my topic and <a href="https://www.weebly.com/pricing"> Weebly</a> was the least. Finally, for part four I was to get creative. Furthmore, I had to make up future techonlogies i belived business needed and or would help them. I came up with multiple ideas. Some being; A <a href="https://api.deepai.org/job-view-file/f827c6c2-e631-4411-967a-d63929a4318c/outputs/output.jpg?art-image=true"> robot</a> that goes and travels the world for bussiness owners who need to be two places at once. This robot would go and cover meetings and work for these bussiness owners. The owners would have to instal everything they would like to happen at the meeting into the robot's data base. Another Idea was,<a href+"https://istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/surfacedeskisland.jpg"> Meeting desks and tables</a> could be turned into a technology where they could be generated to turn on so that computers don't have to be used eveerywhere all the time. Overall, this is my accomplishemnts so far regarding my freedom porject.</p>

### Engineering design progress:
<p>So, now that I have not only organized the list of the softwares and hardwares but also brainstormed ideas of technologies, my next step is to see how I can put all the infroamtion I gathered about my topic together to start it. This would be an important factor in my project since everything has to connect to eachother and show how bussiness around the world operate today and how they could operate in the future with the technolgies I beleive are needed.</p>

### Skills: 
<p> During this stage of my preperation for my project, I developed the abilty to think outside the box and more creativly. I also continued to grow into the habit of googling and seatching the internet more better. Both of these skills are very important when it comes to projects like this since I will be involving my own made up ideas and the information I found to it.</p>

### Creativity: 
<p>At first it took me a while to think of ideas that do not sound out of reach and ridicoulous at the same time. To help me, i thought about converstations I have with people, movies I have watched, and news atricles i have read that involve technology. These helped me think more better because I used what I head and saw to make something up I thought would be useful and many ways. At the end, it was a success because I now have ideas that could be benefical for bussiness in the future. </p>

### Googling:
<p>Googling is and will always be a skill needed because it helps find information people have never known about from before. For me, I google what I need to find and then scroll through the websites that pop up. I always make sure to read the title of the website since it tells me what the reading will be about. This helps save time and look better an deeper into things. Due to the way I google, I have been able to find everything i need fast and much more accurate. </p>

### Summary: 
<p> All in all, after finding the software and hardwares, the prices of them, making a list to organize, and thinking about future technologies I am ready to take the upcoming steps of putting everything together and creating a finalized project. </p>
