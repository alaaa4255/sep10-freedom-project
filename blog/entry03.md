<p> Up untill now in the jounrey of my freedom project, I have so far accomplised Four parts. Part one was gathering information about softwares businesses use on a daily or just overall. I had to find links and eloborate on what i found about each software. Part two was just like part A except this time I had to find hardwares bussiness use. For part three, I had to collect everything I did for Parts one and two and create a organized/ordered list. Meaning, that I had to to choose in what way I would want to organize my list of softwares and hardwares. I chose to list the softwares and hardwares of my project based off of how much they cost. I put the most expensive on the top and the least on the bottom. Now, I had just completed part four which was to get creative. Furthmore, I had to make up future techonlogies i belive business needed and or would help them.    </p>
